(pass_from, time_stamp) is the primary key for this table.
pass_from is a foreign key to player_id from Teams table.
Each row represents a pass made during a match, time_stamp represents the time in minutes (00:00-90:00) when the pass was made,
pass_to is the player_id of the player receiving the pass.

Write a solution to calculate the dominance score for each team in both halves of the match. The rules are as follows:

A match is divided into two halves: first half (00:00-45:00 minutes) and second half (45:01-90:00 minutes)
The dominance score is calculated based on successful and intercepted passes:
When pass_to is a player from the same team: +1 point
When pass_to is a player from the opposing team (interception): -1 point
A higher dominance score indicates better passing performance

Return the result table ordered by team_name and half_number in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example:

Input:

Teams table:

++--+
| 1          | Arsenal   |
| 2          | Arsenal   |
| 3          | Arsenal   |
| 4          | Chelsea   |
| 5          | Chelsea   |
| 6          | Chelsea   |
++--++--++--++--+-+--+-+--+-+-----+
Explanation:

First Half (00:00-45:00):
Arsenal's passes:
1 → 2 (00:15): Successful pass (+1)
2 → 3 (00:45): Successful pass (+1)
3 → 1 (01:15): Successful pass (+1)
Chelsea's passes:
4 → 1 (00:30): Intercepted by Arsenal (-1)
Second Half (45:01-90:00):
Arsenal's passes:
2 → 3 (46:00): Successful pass (+1)
3 → 4 (46:15): Intercepted by Chelsea (-1)
1 → 2 (46:45): Successful pass (+1)
Chelsea's passes:
5 → 6 (46:30): Successful pass (+1)
The results are ordered by team_name and then half_number
