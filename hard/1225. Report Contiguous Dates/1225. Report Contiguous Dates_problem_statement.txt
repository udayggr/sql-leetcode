success_date is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
This table contains the days of succeeded tasks.
 

A system is running one task every day. Every task is independent of the previous tasks. The tasks can fail or succeed.


Write a solution to report the period_state for each continuous interval of days in the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31.

period_state is 'failed' if tasks in this interval failed or 'succeeded' if tasks in this interval succeeded. Interval of days are retrieved as start_date and end_date.

Return the result table ordered by start_date.

The result format is in the following example.
