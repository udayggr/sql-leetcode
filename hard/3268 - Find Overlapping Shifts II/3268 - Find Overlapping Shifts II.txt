Problem Statement
You are given a table EmployeeShifts with the following schema:

| employee_id      | int      |
| start_time       | datetime |
| end_time         | datetime |

For each employee, return:
- employee_id – the employee’s ID
- max_overlapping_shifts – the maximum number of shifts that overlap at any point in time
- total_overlap_duration – the total duration (in minutes) of overlapping time across all pairs of shifts


Example
Input: EmployeeShifts
employee_id 	start_time	end_time
1	'2023-01-01 09:00:00'	'2023-01-01 17:00:00'
1	'2023-01-01 12:00:00'	'2023-01-01 20:00:00'
2	'2023-01-01 10:00:00'	'2023-01-01 14:00:00'
2	'2023-01-01 12:00:00'	'2023-01-01 16:00:00'
2	'2023-01-01 15:00:00'	'2023-01-01 18:00:00'


Output
employee_id	max_overlapping_shifts	total_overlap_duration
1	2	300
2	2	180


Explanation
- Employee 1
- From 16:00 to 17:00, all 3 shifts overlap → max_overlapping_shifts = 3.
- Overlap durations:
- Shift 1 & 2: 120 minutes
- Shift 1 & 3: 60 minutes
- Shift 2 & 3: 420 minutes
- Total = 600 minutes
- Employee 2
- From 11:00 to 17:00, both shifts overlap → max_overlapping_shifts = 2.
- Overlap duration = 480 minutes

Do you want me to also write the SQL solution for this problem so you can practice it hands-on?
