(student_id, course_id, semester) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains the student ID, course ID, semester, and grade received.

Write a solution to find the students who meet the following criteria:

Have taken all mandatory courses and at least two elective courses offered in their major.
Achieved a grade of A in all mandatory courses and at least B in elective courses.
Maintained an average GPA of at least 2.5 across all their courses (including those outside their major).
Return the result table ordered by student_id in ascending order.

Explanation:

Alice (student_id 1) is a Computer Science major and has taken both Algorithms and Data Structures, receiving an A in both. She has also taken Machine Learning and Operating Systems as electives, receiving an A and B respectively.
Bob (student_id 2) is a Computer Science major but did not receive an A in all required courses.
Charlie (student_id 3) is a Mathematics major and has taken both Calculus and Linear Algebra, receiving an A in both. He has also taken Probability and Statistics as electives, receiving an A and B respectively.
David (student_id 4) is a Mathematics major but did not receive an A in all required courses.
Note: Output table is ordered by student_id in ascending order.
